CPSC 219 Project

We are making the game Asteroids.

Our code for our first demo is in the folder Demo1Code. This folder contains the console version of our game.
This version contains our obstacles (asteroids), our avatar (spaceship), and allows the user to interact with the game by attempting to dodge the asteroids.

The final version of our game will give the player/user the ability to shoot at the asteroids and destroy them.
