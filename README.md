README - UPDATED 


We are still making the game Asteroids,

Our code for our first demo is in the folder Demo1Code. This folder contains the console version of our game.
This version contains our obstacles (asteroids), our avatar (spaceship), and allows the user to interact with the game by attempting to dodge the asteroids.

Our code for our second demo is in the folder Demo 2. This folder contains the first version of our game with graphics. Here we have ... classes for Spaceship (the avatar) which can generate instances of the Shot class which let the user shoot the Asteroids (the obstacles). The game is run through the main class Asteroids Game.

Our code for our third demo is in the folder Demo 3. This folder will contain our starting menu which handles users clicking and begining the game. The majority of the code for the start menu is located in the ViewManager file under the View class. Our final step for the final demo is to be able to connect the menu and beggin a new instance of the Asteroids game.
