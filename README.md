CPSC 219 Project

We are making the game Asteroids.

Our code for our first demo is in the folder Demo1Code. This folder contains the console version of our game.
This version contains our obstacles (asteroids), our avatar (spaceship), and allows the user to interact with the game by attempting to dodge the asteroids.

Our code for our second demo is in the folder Demo 2. Thif folder contains the first version of our game with graphics. Here we have ... classes for Spaceship (the avatar) which can generate instances of the Shot class which let the user shoot the Asteroids (the obstacles). The game is run through the main class Asteroids Game.
