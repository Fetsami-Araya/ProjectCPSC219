README File Demo 1 // Without Shooting

So to run the Asteroids game simply download all the required files which contains: Asteroid, AsteroidsGame, Map, Shot, Spaceship. Then run the AsteroidsGame and play the game to try and dodge the asteroids. 
- W: Moves Forwards
- A: Moves Left
- D: Moves Right
- S: Moves down

If you collide with either asteroids which are denoted by capital A and a, the game will simply be over. For this version of our demo we only have 1 life, however, in the future versions of our game we will begin the game with 4 lives and have it decrement each time we collide with an asteroid and lose a life. 

If the two asteroids A and a, are at the same location on the board we will simply display A. In future versions of the game we will have the same asteroids so if they are in the same location they will be as one.
